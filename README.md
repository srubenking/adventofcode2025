# Advent of Code 2025

<details>
  <summary>Day 1 (spoilers!)</summary>
  
  ## Part 1
  First attempt was a failure. Found that I wasn't accounting for rotations that brought the number lower than -100.

  Fixed this but still wrong.

  Wasn't accounting for numbers higher than 99! My fault for trying to do this at almost 3 in the morning.

  ## Part 2
  Again, first attempt failed, must be not accounting for something.
